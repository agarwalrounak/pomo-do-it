# Pomo-Do-It: Your Online Pomodoro Timer

[Pomo-Do-It](https://pomo-do-it.vercel.app/) implements the Pomodoro technique. Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break 
down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a 
pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato'. After four pomodoros, one can take a longer break (15â€“30 minutes).
